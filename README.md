## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://github.com/mohamadjavadzare/Django-Blog-CBV-DRF/blob/main/core/assets/img/shot-1.png)

Welcome to this repository, a comprehensive blog web project that incorporates a powerful stack of tools and technologies. This project leverages Python, Django, Django REST Framework, Docker, Nginx, Redis, PostgreSQL, Gunicorn, and Celery to create a robust and dynamic blogging platform.

This repository serves as a valuable resource for developers interested in building their own feature-rich blog platforms. Explore the codebase, learn from the implementation details, and leverage the power of these tools and technologies to create a scalable and dynamic blog web application.

## Built With

Built on Python, the repository utilizes Django, a high-level web framework, to provide a solid foundation for developing the blog application. Django REST Framework is integrated to enable the creation of RESTful APIs, allowing seamless interaction and data exchange with the blog platform.

Docker is employed for containerization, facilitating easy deployment and management of the entire application stack. Nginx acts as a web server and reverse proxy, ensuring efficient routing and handling of incoming requests. Redis, an in-memory data store, is utilized for caching and enhancing the performance of the blog application.

PostgreSQL, a reliable relational database management system, is integrated to provide secure and efficient storage for the blog's data. Gunicorn serves as the application server, handling incoming requests and managing the execution of the Django application.

Additionally, Celery, a distributed task queue system, is implemented to handle background tasks and improve the responsiveness of the blog platform.
